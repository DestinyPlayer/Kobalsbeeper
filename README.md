The ```install.bat``` script should automagically install everything you need to run this script, so long as you have Python installed on your PC.

### In order to get ```AppID``` and ```App Secret```: 
  1. [Go here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), and create a new Application.
  2. Then go into Manage.
  3. ClientID will be your AppID
  4. Press New Secret to create a new App Secret, and put that into your App Secret.
  
```channelName``` is literally your Twitch username

Everything else is self explanatory
